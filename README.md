Bootstrap DateClockTime Picker
==============================

WHAT IS THIS?

A mix of a Bootstrap DatePicker and a ClockTimePicker in one control.
Let's say you want a mix of this (or the bootstrap standar one): https://github.com/smalot/bootstrap-datetimepicker
And this: https://github.com/weareoutman/clockpicker

Well... then this is that component.

ATTENTION:

THIS COMPONENT IS IN VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT PROCCESS, DUE I DON'T HAVE MUCH SPARE TIME, YOU'RE MORE THAN WELLCOME TO CONTRIBUTE!


FEATURES:
* Date and time picker
* Touch friendly (even in mobile devices!)
* Cool!


TO-DO:
* Select time and put the right value in the input (support input!)
* Support 12 or 24 hours config.
* Support time options and configurations
* Display correctly today and other buttons in date views
* Display correctly PM-AM buttons in time view
* Display the full date and time on the top of the time view (display it as well while changing in the clock picker)
* Hide backward and forward buttons in time view
* Clean-up code
* Raise events when something happen (when initialized, when selected date, when selected time...)
* What ever you find to improve (a lot) or to solve (much more)...

ROADMAP:
* Inline and popover versions (right now it is just tested as inline version and fixed size...)
* Allow the user select different parts of the datetime value and jump directly into that view (e.g: click on "hours" part of the datetime value would jump directly to the hours view)
* Admit different date, time and datetime formats (maybe integrate moment.js?)
* Admit two different imputs for both date and time parts
* What ever you think is cool for this component...

ENJOY!

:-)
